Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance

Project Description:
I have been tasked to create a project to extract data from the organisations RDS Database regarding loans that the organisation have given and I will use that data to analyse patterns, relationships and anomalies within the loan data and to provide a visual representation or figures utilising that data for the institution to utilise for their business practices and notice any certain weaknesses and strengths regarding their methods.
This project will help the organisation make informed decisions regarding their loan approvals, pricings and risk management coinciding with their business practices. This will help create a visualisation of a large database into a more readable and person friendly representation of data to show to anyone concerned/related to the organisation or to any future investors/partners of the organisation.
This will allow me to assess the risks and returns regarding the loan portfolio from the organisation and to provide any insights on how they can improve the performance and profitability of the business' loans as the penultimate goal with this project.
